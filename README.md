# json-parser
A JSON parser written in C.

Dinamically allocates memory only once, all data is stored in contiguous memory.

It's pretty fast.

# TODO
- put print functions in a separate file;
- create functions to easily get fields from the parsed json data;
- eliminate dependencies;
- make it faster.
